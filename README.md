# Watch-MSI-2024-Python-Script
Python script that opens your default web browser to MSI 2024 on the Twitch player 10 minutes before the official stream start.  
I couldn't get the tab scheduler chrome extension to work so this is what I came up with.
I had to do "pip install schedule".  The other imported modules are either native to python or I already had them installed.
I made it into an exe file with "pyinstaller --onefile watch_msi.py" in command line in the python directory.  That may be the way to go actually if you have never opened cmd so it's in the repo.
All it does is open and run the python code.
